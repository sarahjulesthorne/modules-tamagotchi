# Modules Tamagotchi  
## Description  
Project creates sample tamagotchi vitual pet.  
Each quadrant offers a different way to interact with your virtual pet.  
The buttons manipulate your pet's stats up to but never exceeding 100.  
Project created by building a set of modules which fed information/functions to each other in a chain pattern.  
SASS variables and nesting used for styling.  
Personal Take-away was that I need to write less convoluted code, but given my structure of module interaction, I am happy I achieved functionality.
